The Lexer is the foundation of the language and should therefore be perfected and be solid.
Things to consider:
 - How broad or narrow the token categories should be 
 - How to distinguish code from data, especially for quoted lists
 - Ensuring the lexer is clean, solid and future proof

Token Types:
 - LPAREN
 - RPAREN
 - QUOTE
 - ATOM (Symbols including operators)
 - NUMBER
 - STRING
